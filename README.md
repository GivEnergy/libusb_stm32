## GivEnergy modifications

This copy of libusb_stm32 is modified for use with HemsDongle[1]
and contains only the STM32F103 USB driver, and the subset of USB
headers that we need.

Modified source files are marked with "MODIFIED BY GIVENERGY".
The specific changes made are tracked in Git rather than being
called out at every point.
